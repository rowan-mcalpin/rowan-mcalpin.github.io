            <p>Hi! I'm Rowan McAlpin. I'm a 16-year old acrobat, programmer, and guitarist. I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, where I currently live. Due to the varied nature of my areas of expertise, this site is divided into four main sections, listing my skills, experience, history, and plans going forward.</p>

            <h3>School History</h3>
            <p>
                For my first three years of elementary school, I attended Salmon Bay K-8, a standard public school. In third grade, I switched to the Cascade Parent 
                Partnership Program, a hybrid homeschooling program, which enabled me to dedicate more time to circus training, programming, and guitar. I transferred 
                again in 2021 to Edmonds Heights K-12, where I joined the school's <a href="https://atomicrobotics3805.org/" target="_blank">robotics team</a>. Edmonds Heights K-12 is another hybrid homeschooling program 
                that continues through high school. I will graduate from Edmonds Heights in 2026.

            <h3>Circus and Acrobatics</h3>
            <p>
                In 2012, I enrolled at the <a href="https://sancaseattle.org/" target="_blank">School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts</a> (SANCA) 
                in Georgetown, Washington, where I participated in skillbuilding classes for the next five years, learning a variety of disciplines such as 
                aerial silks, unicycle, tumbling, partner acrobatics, and juggling. After around 5 years, I chose to dive deeper into aerial arts, particularly 
                focusing on aerial silks and static trapeze. In 2019, I joined Celestial Circus, one of SANCA's youth performance troupes, and remained with 
                them until 2023, after performing at many notable venues such as Teatro Zinzanni, The Triple Door, and the Paramount Theatre among others.

            <h3>Computer Programming and Software Development</h3>
            <p>

                I am an accomplished programmer, and am the software lead for my school's robotics team. I have been programming with C# and Kotlin since 2021, and
                Java since 2018. I have a solid understanding of control flow and object-oriented principles, and have written & co-written multiple different projects.
